% =====================================================
% TO DO
% =====================================================

%  *  A few words on how to use the commands in general.
%
%  *  Mixed partial derivatives. (Long term project!)
%
%  *  Function definitions. (Probably too many moving parts for it to be easier with a dedicated command.)
%
%  *  Consider generalising \Ltwo to general L^p spaces.
%
%  *  Consider redefining intervals to take two arguments.
%
%  *  More convenient way to make roman subscripts (and super-?).
%
%  *  Differentials: Find automatic way to check if the next symbol is a full stop or comma, in which case the spacing should be diminished. Until then, making the punctuation part of the argument solves the problem (but it's a hack).
%
%  *  Consider separating \inner out into physics and mathematics specific files. Especially since the definition is now more complex. Or define the delimiter globally elsewhere.
%
%  *  Conditional probabilities.
%
%  *  Automatically check whether a vector is Latin or not. (Seems a bit complicated to do in general, may rely on xparse.)
%
%  *  Infinite sequence: Automatically detect the (maybe?) last letter of the input and start it from that letter = 1 by default. (Is this maybe too computationally expensive?)
%
%  *  DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP: Can it take optional arguments? I.e., is it really necessary to define auxilliary commands? It really shouldn't be!



% =====================================================
% Notes
% =====================================================

%  *  This script redefines the following commands:
%		\deg
%		\d		(redefined as \underdot)
%		\det
%		\dim
%		\div	(redefined as \divsymb)
%		\Im
%		\ker
%		\Re
%		\vec
%
%  *  In case of alignment issues or other problems with vectors, see https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10643/63353.
%
%  *  Note that '\span' is a primitive command used in \multicolumn (see https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/33264/span-as-a-math-operator), so the span of a set of vectors is defined as '\Span'.
%
%  *  L^2: Explicit domains should probably be specified manually, since they in general require parentheses (for instance L^2(R)), but not in the case of intervals. But consider using an if-statement to check.
